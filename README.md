# Copong for iPhone

A Pong clone made with Cocos2D for iPhone v0.8.2.

## Build

The project assumes a Xcode source tree entry named `COCOS2D_SRC`, pointing to your Cocos2D folder.

Other than that, you shouldn't have much trouble building it.

## Meta

* Code: `git clone git://github.com/unindented/copong-iphone.git`
